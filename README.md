# Hi, I'm Moe!

## Welcome to my GitHub! 👋🏻

*I am currently looking for a January opportunity in India and a summer opportunity anywhere in the world* 🌍

## 👧🏻  About Me 🇫🇷 🇧🇩 🇺🇸

I'm a college student in the US from Japan! 🇯🇵 
I am very interested in how the digital ads generate revenue from their business models and also how Artificial Intelligence can help politics in ways such as analyzing public policies suggesting actions. I am also interested in new systems of economy through the development of financial technologies. 

I am also a third-culture-kid who grew up in France, Bangladesh, and the US (Hawaii). 
I love meeting new people with different values because I believe in what is learned from the challenges.  

I have an intense drive to learn and will learn new languages through reading code!
